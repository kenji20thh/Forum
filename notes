1. Implement Home Handler
 HomeHandler: Display a list of posts (even if it's static for now, as you can connect it to the database later).

 Add a basic HTML page to display posts.

2. Implement Registration and Login Handlers
 RegisterHandler:

Collect email, username, and password.

Validate if the email is already taken and respond accordingly.

Hash the password (you can use bcrypt here).

Store the new user data in the SQLite database.

 LoginHandler:

Collect email and password.

Verify the credentials with the stored data.

Set a session cookie (you can use a UUID here if you like) to store the user's logged-in status.

3. Set Up Session Management
 Implement cookie-based session management to keep track of logged-in users.

 Ensure sessions have expiration times (set the expiration when you set the cookie).

 Use a session verification middleware to check if a user is logged in when accessing certain routes.

4. Set Up Database Queries for Users
 Write SQL queries to interact with the database:

Insert new users.

Check if an email already exists.

Verify user credentials during login.

5. Create Basic HTML Pages
 Home Page:

Display posts and comments.

Provide links to login and register.

 Register Page: Simple form to input email, username, and password.

 Login Page: Simple form to input email and password.

6. Test Registration and Login
 Test the registration and login flows to ensure they work properly.

 Check that cookies are set correctly and the session lasts for the desired duration.

7. Next Steps After Authentication
Once the authentication system is functioning, move on to the functionality for posts, comments, likes/dislikes, and filtering. Let me know if you'd like to work through those tasks next!
